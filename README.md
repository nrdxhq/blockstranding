## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Technical Features

### Ephemeral Rollups Integration

The game operates on MagicBlock‚Äôs real-time engine, a breakthrough execution layer built on Solana.

Using Ephemeral Rollups, MagicBlock enables:
- 10ms transaction latency compared to 400ms on native Solana
- Zero fees for players after initial funding
- Real-time execution of all interactions
- Seamless composability with Solana‚Äôs base layer

This allows Block Stranding to achieve Web2-level responsiveness while remaining fully decentralized.

### Fully Onchain & Gas-Free Gameplay

All game actions ‚Äî including movement, collecting, combat, and more ‚Äî are processed and verified directly onchain in real time.  
Players pay a one-time entry fee of ~0.005 SOL at the start of the game. After that, all gameplay is gas-free.
